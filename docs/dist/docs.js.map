in three phases: <strong>start</strong>, <strong>upload</strong>,<strong>finish</strong></p>\\n\\n#### start\\n\\nThis is the first phase of the process. We'll tell the backend that we are going to upload a file, with certain `size`, `name` and `mime_type`.\\n\\nUse the option `startBody` to add more parameters to the body of this request.\\n\\nThe backend should provide a `session_id` (to identify the upload) and a `end_offset` which is the size of every chunk\\n\\n##### HTTP start phase example\\n\\nRequest body example:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"phase\\\": \\\"start\\\",\\n  \\\"mime_type\\\": \\\"image/png\\\",\\n  \\\"size\\\": 12669430,\\n  \\\"name\\\":\\\"hubbleimage1stscihp1809af6400x4800.png\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nResponse body example:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"end_offset\\\": 6291456,\\n    \\\"session_id\\\": \\\"61db8102-fca6-44ae-81e2-a499d438e7a5\\\"\\n  },\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\"\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n#### upload\\n\\nIn this phase we'll upload every chunk until all of them are uploaded. This step allows some failures in the backend, and will retry up to `maxRetries` times.\\n\\nWe'll send the `session_id`, `start_offset` and `chunk` (the sliced blob - part of file we are uploading). We expect the backend to return `{ status: 'success' }`, we'll retry otherwise.\\n\\nUse the option `uploadBody` to add more parameters to the body of this request.\\n\\n##### HTTP upload phase example with 3 chunks\\n\\nRequest body example - chunk 1 from 3:\\n```\\n------WebKitFormBoundaryuI0uiY8h7MCbcysx\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"phase\\\"\\n\\nupload\\n------WebKitFormBoundaryuI0uiY8h7MCbcysx\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"session_id\\\"\\n\\n61db8102-fca6-44ae-81e2-a499d438e7a5\\n------WebKitFormBoundaryuI0uiY8h7MCbcysx\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"start_offset\\\"\\n\\n0\\n------WebKitFormBoundaryuI0uiY8h7MCbcysx\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"chunk\\\"; filename=\\\"blob\\\"\\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\\n\\n\\n------WebKitFormBoundaryuI0uiY8h7MCbcysx--\\n```\\n\\nResponse body example - chunk 1 from 3:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRequest body example - chunk 2 from 3:\\n```\\n------WebKitFormBoundary4cjBupFqrx1SrHoR\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"phase\\\"\\n\\nupload\\n------WebKitFormBoundary4cjBupFqrx1SrHoR\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"session_id\\\"\\n\\n61db8102-fca6-44ae-81e2-a499d438e7a5\\n------WebKitFormBoundary4cjBupFqrx1SrHoR\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"start_offset\\\"\\n\\n6291456\\n------WebKitFormBoundary4cjBupFqrx1SrHoR\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"chunk\\\"; filename=\\\"blob\\\"\\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\\n\\n\\n------WebKitFormBoundary4cjBupFqrx1SrHoR-\\n```\\n\\nResponse body example - chunk 2 from 3:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nRequest body example - chunk 3 from 3:\\n```\\n------WebKitFormBoundarypWxg4xnB5QBDoFys\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"phase\\\"\\n\\nupload\\n------WebKitFormBoundarypWxg4xnB5QBDoFys\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"session_id\\\"\\n\\n61db8102-fca6-44ae-81e2-a499d438e7a5\\n------WebKitFormBoundarypWxg4xnB5QBDoFys\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"start_offset\\\"\\n\\n12582912\\n------WebKitFormBoundarypWxg4xnB5QBDoFys\\nContent-Disposition: form-data; name=\\\"chunk\\\"; filename=\\\"blob\\\"\\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\\n\\n\\n------WebKitFormBoundarypWxg4xnB5QBDoFys--\\n```\\n\\nResponse body example - chunk 1 from 3:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### finish\\n\\nIn this phase we tell the backend that there are no more chunks to upload, so it can wrap everything. We send the `session_id` in this phase.\\n\\nUse the option `finishBody` to add more parameters to the body of this request.\\n\\n##### HTTP finish phase example\\n\\nRequest body example:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"phase\\\": \\\"finish\\\",\\n  \\\"session_id\\\": \\\"61db8102-fca6-44ae-81e2-a499d438e7a5\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nResponse body example:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"status\\\": \\\"success\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Example\\n\\nIn the following example we are going to add `Chunk Upload Functionality`. This component will use `Chunk Upload` when the size of the file is > `1MB`, it will behave as the `Simple example` when the size of the file is lower.\\n\\n```html\\n  <file-upload\\n    ref=\\\"upload\\\"\\n    v-model=\\\"files\\\"\\n    post-action=\\\"/post.method\\\"\\n    put-action=\\\"/put.method\\\"\\n\\n    chunk-enabled\\n    :chunk=\\\"{\\n      action: '/upload/chunk',\\n      minSize: 1048576,\\n      maxActive: 3,\\n      maxRetries: 5,\\n\\n      // Example in the case your backend also needs the user id to operate\\n      startBody: {\\n        user_id: user.id\\n      }\\n    }\\\"\\n\\n    @input-file=\\\"inputFile\\\"\\n    @input-filter=\\\"inputFilter\\\"\\n  >\\n  Upload file\\n  </file-upload>\\n```\\n\\n#### Extending the handler\\n\\nWe are using the class `src/chunk/ChunkUploadHandler` class to implement this protocol. You can extend this class (or even create a different one from scratch) to implement your own way to communicat with the backend.\\n\\nThis class must implement a method called `upload` which **must** return a promise. This promise will be used by the `FileUpload` component to determinate whether the file was uploaded or failed.\\n\\nUse the `handler` parameter to use a different Handler\\n\\n```html\\n :chunk=\\\"{\\n   action: '/upload/chunk',\\n   minSize: 1048576,\\n   maxActive: 3,\\n   maxRetries: 5,\\n\\n   handler: MyHandlerClass\\n }\\n```\\n\\n### SSR (Server
